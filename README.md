# Portfolio 
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/6499868d-a7b1-4ae4-86a6-c495262047b2/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/daempasha/deploys)

*Portfolio website that contains all of my personal projects and achievements.*

# Aim
The aim was to create a personal page where I can talk about all of my personal projects that I've been working on. Previously, I was using a static site for my portfolio this meant that any time I added a project, I would have to rebuild and reupload the site. Therefore, in this version I intend to utilise a CMS back-end to allow me to add and remove content at will during production.

# CD (Continuous Deployment):
This project utilises Netlify for CD, this will automatically retrieve the latest commits from the `main` branch and then upload and build to the website.

# CMS
This project also features a fully customizable CMS that has been tailored specifically for this website, this means projects can easily be added whilst the product is deployed and it will refresh and obtain the latest data.
